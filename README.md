# IoTtalk
The IoTtalk system is an IoT device platform based on the concept of device features. When the IoT device is connected to the system, for various sensors, IoTtalk will automatically generate or use application software to process. Therefore, every input device can be easily connected to output devices.

## IoTtalk versions
This repository contains the code for the open-source IoTtalk. The code for IoTtalk 1.0 and IoTtalk 2.0 is not available since they are commercial software maintained by the IoTtalk team.
